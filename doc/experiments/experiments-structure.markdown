# EXPERIMENTS-STRUCTURE

Each **experiment** has the following structure:

    detections
        -> detections folder
    log
        -> log folder
    metrics-train
        -> metrics-train folder
    metrics-test
        -> metrics-test folder
    models
        -> models folder
    output
        -> output folder
    plots-test
        -> plots-test folder
    plots-train
        -> plots-train folder
